# Blue-Noise

[Paper](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf) discribed an algorithm to generate blue noise of arbitary dimension in O(N) time, where N is the number of samples of noise.

This project implement this algorithm in C++, and visualize the 2-D situation in OpenGL framework, and write any outcome of other dimensions into file.
